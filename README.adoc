= Low-Latency Performance Workshop for OpenShift 4.19

== Introduction

This repository hosts the comprehensive lab guide for the **Low-Latency Performance Workshop**, designed to teach OpenShift 4.19 performance optimization through hands-on exercises using modern tooling and GitOps practices.

The workshop can be delivered by Red Hat Associates, partners, and community members to customers and interested parties worldwide.

It is designed to work with the Showroom lab environment provided by the Red Hat Demo Platform (RHDP) team, as well as customer environments and self-paced learning scenarios.

This workshop provides hands-on experience with **low-latency performance optimization** in OpenShift 4.19, covering everything from baseline performance testing to advanced virtualization optimization.

**Low-latency performance optimization** enables organizations to achieve deterministic, predictable performance for time-sensitive workloads such as financial trading systems, industrial automation, telecommunications, and real-time analytics.

In this workshop, participants will explore comprehensive performance optimization techniques that platform engineers, SREs, and performance specialists encounter when building and maintaining high-performance OpenShift environments.

== Who Will Benefit Most from This Workshop?

**Platform Engineers & SREs** -- Those responsible for designing, deploying, and maintaining OpenShift clusters that require predictable, low-latency performance. These professionals need to understand CPU isolation, memory optimization, and performance monitoring to meet strict SLA requirements.

**Performance Specialists** -- Those responsible for optimizing application performance and conducting performance testing in containerized and virtualized environments. These users need expertise in performance profiling, bottleneck identification, and optimization validation.

**DevOps Engineers** -- Those implementing GitOps workflows for performance-critical applications and infrastructure. These professionals need to understand how to deploy and manage performance optimizations through automated pipelines.

**Solutions Architects** -- Those designing OpenShift solutions for performance-sensitive use cases. These users need to understand the trade-offs and capabilities of different performance optimization approaches.
== What Content Is Covered In The Workshop?

The workshop consists of **6 comprehensive modules** that build upon each other to provide complete low-latency performance optimization expertise:

**Module 1: Low-Latency Performance Fundamentals** -- Introduction to low-latency concepts, OpenShift 4.19 performance features, workshop architecture, and prerequisites. Participants learn the theoretical foundation and prepare their environment.

**Module 2: RHACM and ArgoCD Integration Setup** -- Hands-on setup of Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management and GitOps workflows using ArgoCD. Participants deploy OpenShift Virtualization and SR-IOV operators using modern GitOps practices.

**Module 3: Baseline Performance Testing** -- Comprehensive performance baseline establishment using kube-burner v1.17+. Participants learn modern performance testing methodologies and establish measurable baselines for optimization comparison.

**Module 4: Core Performance Tuning** -- Deep dive into Performance Profiles, CPU isolation, HugePages configuration, and real-time kernel optimization. Participants apply and validate core performance optimizations.

**Module 5: Low-Latency Virtualization** -- Advanced virtual machine optimization using OpenShift Virtualization, including VMI latency testing, SR-IOV networking, and network policy performance analysis. Participants optimize VMs for low-latency workloads.

**Module 6: Monitoring and Validation** -- Production-ready monitoring setup with Prometheus and Grafana, comprehensive performance validation across all optimization types, and continuous performance testing implementation. Participants establish sustainable performance assurance practices.
