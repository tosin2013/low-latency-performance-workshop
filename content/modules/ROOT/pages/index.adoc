[%hardbreaks]
== Introduction

Welcome to the comprehensive OpenShift Low-Latency Performance Workshop! This hands-on workshop will guide you through implementing high-performance, low-latency workloads on OpenShift 4.19 using enterprise-grade tuning techniques and Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM).

This workshop demonstrates real-world scenarios where microsecond-level latency matters, including financial trading systems, real-time gaming, IoT edge computing, and high-frequency data processing applications.

== Who Will Benefit Most from Attending?

*Platform Engineers & SREs* -- Learn advanced OpenShift performance tuning, CPU isolation, real-time kernel configuration, and automated cluster management at scale.

*Application Architects* -- Understand how to design containerized applications for ultra-low latency requirements while leveraging GitOps workflows and multi-cluster management.

*DevOps Engineers* -- Master the integration of RHACM with ArgoCD for consistent performance profile deployment across development, staging, and production environments.

== What Content Is Covered?

These are the *key modules* that will be covered:

* _Module 1: Low-Latency Fundamentals_: Understanding latency requirements, OpenShift performance features, and workshop architecture overview.

* _Module 2: RHACM & ArgoCD Integration_: Setting up Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management with ArgoCD for automated multi-cluster performance deployments.

* _Module 3: Baseline Performance Testing_: Using kube-burner to establish performance baselines and measure pod creation latency metrics.

* _Module 4: Core Performance Tuning_: Implementing Performance Profiles for CPU isolation, HugePages configuration, and real-time kernel enablement.

* _Module 5: Low-Latency Virtualization_: Optimizing OpenShift Virtualization for low-latency workloads with SR-IOV networking and VM performance tuning.

* _Module 6: Monitoring & Validation_: Advanced performance monitoring, validation tools, and best practices for maintaining low-latency environments.

* _Module 7: Case Study & Conclusion_: Real-world implementation example, lessons learned, and next steps for production deployment.

== What is Low-Latency Performance?

* **Microsecond Response Times**: Applications requiring sub-millisecond response times for critical operations
* **CPU Isolation**: Dedicated CPU cores for time-sensitive workloads without interference from system processes  
* **Real-time Kernels**: Deterministic scheduling and reduced jitter for predictable performance
* **Hardware Acceleration**: Direct hardware access via SR-IOV for network-intensive applications
* **Memory Optimization**: HugePages and NUMA-aware allocation for reduced memory management overhead

## Workshop Technologies
