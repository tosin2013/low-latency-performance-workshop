= Module 1: Introduction to Low-Latency Computing and OpenShift

[%hardbreaks]
== Module Overview

This module introduces the fundamentals of low-latency computing and demonstrates why OpenShift is an ideal platform for high-performance, time-sensitive workloads. You will learn about real-world use cases, performance characteristics, and the role of Kubernetes Operators in managing complex performance configurations.

.*Learning Objectives*

* Understand what low-latency means and why it matters for modern applications
* Learn about real-world use cases requiring microsecond response times
* Explore OpenShift's role in high-performance computing environments
* Identify latency challenges in containerized environments
* Introduction to Kubernetes Operators for performance management

.*Workshop Prerequisites*

This workshop requires:

* Access to a Single Node OpenShift (SNO) cluster (covered in Module 2)
* SSH access to bastion host with pre-configured tools
* Basic understanding of OpenShift and Kubernetes concepts

== What is Low-Latency and Why Does it Matter?

.*Definition*
Latency, or response time, is the time between an event and the system's response, typically measured in microseconds (µs). Low-latency computing focuses on achieving predictable, minimal response times for time-sensitive applications.

.*Importance*
Many industries and organizations, especially in finance and telecommunications, require extremely high performance computing with low and predictable latency. Even small delays can result in:

* Lost trading opportunities worth millions of dollars
* Degraded user experience in real-time applications
* Violation of Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
* Competitive disadvantage in time-sensitive markets

.*Key Use Cases*

* *Financial Trading*: High-frequency trading platforms requiring microsecond response times
* *Telecommunications*: Real-time voice and video processing with strict latency budgets
* *Gaming*: Online gaming platforms where milliseconds determine user experience
* *Industrial IoT*: Real-time control systems and automation requiring deterministic responses
* *Live Streaming*: Media processing and delivery with minimal delay
* *Autonomous Vehicles*: Safety-critical systems requiring immediate response to sensor data

== OpenShift's Role in High-Performance Computing

.*Capability Overview*
Exchanges, banks, hedge funds, and financial intermediaries can run high-throughput/low-latency trading on OpenShift with performance characteristics similar to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). This enables organizations to containerize their most demanding workloads without sacrificing performance.

.*Performance Metrics*
Real-world benchmarks demonstrate OpenShift's capability:

* *At 100,000 messages/second*: RHEL and OpenShift exhibit nearly identical 99th percentile latency (2 µsec vs. 2.3 µsec)
* *At 1,400,000 messages/second*: OpenShift's 99th percentile latency was 2.8 µsec
* *Production deployments*: Tier 1 banks achieving 16x transaction capacity increase over legacy platforms

.*Enterprise Benefits*
OpenShift enables organizations to achieve high performance while providing:

* *Improved Manageability*: Kubernetes-native orchestration and automation
* *Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)*: Reduced operational overhead compared to traditional infrastructure
* *Improved Developer Productivity*: Container-based development and deployment workflows
* *Reduced Application Downtime*: Built-in high availability and automated recovery
* *More Efficient DevOps*: GitOps workflows and automated operations
* *Improved Security Posture*: Immutable CoreOS foundation and integrated security controls

== Latency Challenges in Containerized Environments

Understanding the sources of latency is crucial for effective optimization. OpenShift helps mitigate several key challenges:

.*Common Sources of Latency*
* *Control-plane Overhead*: Kubernetes API server and scheduler delays
* *Kernel Jitter*: Context switches, interrupts, and memory management overhead
* *Container Runtime Path*: CRI-O, overlay filesystems, and namespace overhead
* *Network CNI Overhead*: Software-defined networking latency
* *Resource Contention*: CPU, memory, and I/O competition between workloads

.*OpenShift Solutions*
* *Node Tuning Operator*: Automated system-level optimizations via TuneD profiles
* *Performance Profile Controller*: Comprehensive CPU isolation and memory tuning
* *Real-time Kernel Support*: Deterministic scheduling and reduced jitter
* *SR-IOV Network Operator*: Hardware-accelerated networking with direct device access
* *NUMA Awareness*: Memory locality optimization for multi-socket systems
* *Machine Config Operator*: Declarative node-level configuration management

== Introduction to Kubernetes Operators

.*What Are Kubernetes Operators?*
A Kubernetes Operator is a method of packaging, deploying, and managing a Kubernetes-native application. They are essentially custom controllers that continuously reconcile the desired state and the current state of an object.

.*Key Characteristics*
* *Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)*: Extend Kubernetes API with domain-specific objects
* *Controllers*: Monitor and maintain desired state automatically
* *Domain-Specific Knowledge*: Encode operational knowledge for specific applications
* *Lifecycle Management*: Handle installation, updates, configuration changes, and scaling

.*Relevance to Performance Tuning*
OpenShift performance tuning features are managed through various Operators. **Important**: Starting with OpenShift 4.11, the performance operator architecture has been significantly updated. This workshop targets **OpenShift 4.20**, which fully implements the modernized architecture:

[cols="1,3,1"]
|===
| Operator | Purpose | Status (4.20)

| *Node Tuning Operator (NTO)*
| Manages TuneD daemon AND Performance Profiles. Since OpenShift 4.11+, this operator has absorbed the functionality of the deprecated Performance Addon Operator
| Built-in ✅

| *Performance Addon Operator (PAO)*
| Previously managed Performance Profiles for CPU isolation, real-time kernels, and HugePages
| **DEPRECATED** ❌

| *Machine Config Operator (MCO)*
| Manages configuration changes and orchestrates updates across the cluster, crucial for performance-related configurations
| Built-in ✅

| *SR-IOV Network Operator*
| Manages Single-Root I/O Virtualization for high-performance networking with direct hardware access
| Requires Installation 📦

| *OpenShift Virtualization Operator*
| Provides KubeVirt virtualization capabilities for running VMs with low-latency characteristics
| Requires Installation 📦
|===

.*Critical Architecture Changes in OpenShift 4.11+ (Including 4.20)*

[NOTE]
====
**Performance Addon Operator Deprecation**: As of OpenShift 4.11, the Performance Addon Operator has been deprecated and its functionality has been integrated into the Node Tuning Operator. **OpenShift 4.20** (our target version) fully implements this modernized architecture:

* **Performance Profiles** are now managed directly by the Node Tuning Operator
* **No separate installation** required for performance profile functionality
* **Simplified deployment** with fewer operators to manage
* **Better integration** between system tuning and performance profiles
* **Mature implementation** with enhanced stability and features

.*Benefits of Operator-Based Management*
* *Declarative Configuration*: Define desired state, operator ensures implementation
* *Automated Operations*: Operators handle complex configuration and lifecycle tasks
* *Consistency*: Standardized deployment and management across environments
* *Version Control*: Configuration as code for auditability and reproducibility

== Workshop Environment

.*Pre-Configured SNO Cluster*
A major financial institution successfully modernized their trading platform using OpenShift:

* *Time to Market*: Reduced functional enhancement delivery from 2-3 months to a few days
* *Operational Efficiency*: Significant reduction in OpEx for colocation versus legacy "snowflake" servers
* *Performance Gains*: 16x increase in daily transaction capacity
* *Infrastructure Optimization*: Achieved high-density deployment with up to 10x less rack space

This demonstrates that with proper tuning, OpenShift can deliver bare-metal performance characteristics while providing the benefits of container orchestration.
