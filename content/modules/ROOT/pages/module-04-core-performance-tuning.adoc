= Module 4: Core Performance Tuning with Performance Profiles

[%hardbreaks]
== Module Overview

This module is the heart of the workshop, where you'll apply node-level performance tuning using OpenShift's Performance Profile Controller. You'll configure CPU isolation, HugePages allocation, and real-time kernel settings to dramatically improve latency characteristics.

.*Learning Objectives*

* Understand Performance Profiles and their components
* Configure CPU isolation for high-performance workloads
* Allocate and manage HugePages for reduced memory latency
* Apply real-time kernel tuning profiles
* Measure the performance improvements from your optimizations

.*Prerequisites*

Before starting this module, ensure you have completed:

* Module 1: Workshop Setup and Multi-Cluster Management
* Module 2: GitOps Deployment and Operator Installation
* Module 3: Baseline Performance Measurement and Analysis
* Established baseline performance metrics using kube-burner from Module 3

== Understanding Performance Profiles

The Performance Profile Controller (PPC) is integrated into the Node Tuning Operator and provides a declarative way to configure multiple low-latency optimizations through a single custom resource.

.*Key Components*
* *CPU Management*: Isolate specific CPUs for high-performance workloads
* *Memory Tuning*: Configure HugePages and memory-related kernel parameters
* *Kernel Tuning*: Apply real-time kernel settings and tuned profiles
* *NUMA Awareness*: Optimize for Non-Uniform Memory Access architectures

.*Performance Profile Benefits*
* *Single Configuration*: One CR manages multiple complex tuning parameters
* *Declarative*: Version-controlled, repeatable configuration
* *Node Pool Isolation*: Apply tuning to specific worker nodes only
* *Rolling Updates*: Orchestrated updates with minimal disruption

== Hands-on Exercise: Creating a Performance Profile

=== Step 1: Identify Target Nodes and Environment

First, we'll identify your cluster architecture and configure the appropriate nodes for performance tuning.

. Switch to your target cluster context:
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc config use-context target-cluster
----

. Detect your cluster architecture:
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
# Check cluster architecture
TOTAL_NODES=$(oc get nodes --no-headers | wc -l)
WORKER_NODES=$(oc get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/worker= --no-headers | wc -l)
MASTER_NODES=$(oc get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/master= --no-headers | wc -l)

echo "=== Cluster Architecture Detection ==="
echo "Total nodes: $TOTAL_NODES"
echo "Master nodes: $MASTER_NODES"
echo "Worker nodes: $WORKER_NODES"

if [ $TOTAL_NODES -eq 1 ]; then
    echo "‚úÖ Detected: Single Node OpenShift (SNO)"
    CLUSTER_TYPE="SNO"
    TARGET_NODE=$(oc get nodes -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
    echo "Target node: $TARGET_NODE"
elif [ $WORKER_NODES -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "‚úÖ Detected: Multi-node cluster with dedicated workers"
    CLUSTER_TYPE="MULTI_NODE"
    TARGET_NODE=$(oc get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/worker= -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
    echo "Target worker node: $TARGET_NODE"
else
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Detected: Multi-node cluster without dedicated workers"
    CLUSTER_TYPE="MULTI_MASTER"
    TARGET_NODE=$(oc get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/master= -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
    echo "Target master node: $TARGET_NODE"
fi

echo "CLUSTER_TYPE=$CLUSTER_TYPE" > /tmp/cluster-config
echo "TARGET_NODE=$TARGET_NODE" >> /tmp/cluster-config
----

. Check node resources and CPU topology:
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
# Load cluster configuration
source /tmp/cluster-config

# Get detailed node information
echo "=== Node Information for $TARGET_NODE ==="
oc describe node $TARGET_NODE | grep -E "(Name:|Roles:|Capacity:|Allocatable:)" -A 10

# Check CPU information
echo "=== CPU Topology ==="
oc debug node/$TARGET_NODE -- chroot /host lscpu | grep -E "(CPU\(s\)|Thread|Core|Socket|NUMA)"
----

. Configure node labels based on cluster type:
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
# Load cluster configuration
source /tmp/cluster-config

if [ "$CLUSTER_TYPE" = "SNO" ]; then
    echo "=== SNO Configuration ==="
    echo "‚úÖ Single Node OpenShift detected - no additional labeling needed"
    echo "Performance Profile will target: node-role.kubernetes.io/master"

elif [ "$CLUSTER_TYPE" = "MULTI_NODE" ]; then
    echo "=== Multi-Node Configuration ==="
    echo "üè∑Ô∏è  Labeling worker node for performance tuning..."

    # Label the worker node(s) for performance tuning
    oc label node $TARGET_NODE node-role.kubernetes.io/worker-rt= --overwrite

    # Verify the label
    echo "‚úÖ Labeled nodes:"
    oc get nodes --show-labels | grep worker-rt

else
    echo "=== Multi-Master Configuration ==="
    echo "üè∑Ô∏è  Labeling master node for performance tuning..."

    # Label a master node for performance tuning (advanced scenario)
    oc label node $TARGET_NODE node-role.kubernetes.io/master-rt= --overwrite

    # Verify the label
    echo "‚úÖ Labeled nodes:"
    oc get nodes --show-labels | grep master-rt
fi
----

=== Step 2: Create Machine Config Pool (Multi-Node Only)

For multi-node clusters, create a dedicated Machine Config Pool to isolate performance configuration changes. SNO clusters can skip this step.

. Create Machine Config Pool based on cluster type:
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
# Load cluster configuration
source /tmp/cluster-config

if [ "$CLUSTER_TYPE" = "SNO" ]; then
    echo "=== SNO Configuration ==="
    echo "‚úÖ Skipping Machine Config Pool creation for Single Node OpenShift"
    echo "üìù SNO uses existing 'master' Machine Config Pool"
    echo ""
    echo "Existing Machine Config Pools:"
    oc get mcp

elif [ "$CLUSTER_TYPE" = "MULTI_NODE" ]; then
    echo "=== Multi-Node Configuration ==="
    echo "üîß Creating dedicated worker-rt Machine Config Pool..."

    cat << 'EOF' | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfigPool
metadata:
  name: worker-rt
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker-rt
spec:
  machineConfigSelector:
    matchExpressions:
    - {key: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role, operator: In, values: [worker, worker-rt]}
  nodeSelector:
    matchLabels:
      node-role.kubernetes.io/worker-rt: ""
  paused: false
EOF

    echo "‚úÖ Created worker-rt Machine Config Pool"

else
    echo "=== Multi-Master Configuration ==="
    echo "üîß Creating dedicated master-rt Machine Config Pool..."

    cat << 'EOF' | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfigPool
metadata:
  name: master-rt
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: master-rt
spec:
  machineConfigSelector:
    matchExpressions:
    - {key: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role, operator: In, values: [master, master-rt]}
  nodeSelector:
    matchLabels:
      node-role.kubernetes.io/master-rt: ""
  paused: false
EOF

    echo "‚úÖ Created master-rt Machine Config Pool"
fi
----

. Verify Machine Config Pool status:
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
# Load cluster configuration
source /tmp/cluster-config

echo "=== Machine Config Pool Status ==="
if [ "$CLUSTER_TYPE" = "SNO" ]; then
    echo "üìã SNO uses existing pools:"
    oc get mcp
else
    echo "üìã All Machine Config Pools:"
    oc get mcp

    if [ "$CLUSTER_TYPE" = "MULTI_NODE" ]; then
        echo ""
        echo "üìä Worker-RT Pool Details:"
        oc get mcp worker-rt -o yaml | grep -A 5 -B 5 "readyMachineCount\|updatedMachineCount"
    else
        echo ""
        echo "üìä Master-RT Pool Details:"
        oc get mcp master-rt -o yaml | grep -A 5 -B 5 "readyMachineCount\|updatedMachineCount"
    fi
fi
----

=== Step 3: Create the Performance Profile

Now we'll create a Performance Profile that configures CPU isolation, HugePages, and real-time kernel settings optimized for your cluster architecture.

. Determine optimal CPU allocation based on your cluster type:
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
# Run the CPU allocation calculator script
bash ~/low-latency-performance-workshop/scripts/module04-calculate-cpu-allocation.sh
----
+
[TIP]
====
**What This Script Does:**

* Detects CPU count on the target node
* Calculates optimal CPU allocation based on cluster type (SNO, Multi-Node, Multi-Master)
* Validates CPU ranges to prevent configuration errors
* Saves configuration to `/tmp/cluster-config` for next steps

**Benefits of Using the Script:**

* **Error Prevention**: Validates CPU ranges before saving
* **Handles Edge Cases**: Prevents division by zero and invalid ranges
* **Clear Output**: Shows allocation strategy and percentages
* **Reusable**: Can be run multiple times to recalculate

The script implements workshop-friendly conservative allocation that preserves cluster functionality while demonstrating performance benefits.
====

. Create the Performance Profile optimized for your cluster architecture:
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
# Run the Performance Profile creation script
bash ~/low-latency-performance-workshop/scripts/module04-create-performance-profile.sh
----
+
[TIP]
====
**What This Script Does:**

* Loads and validates CPU allocation from previous step
* Validates CPU ranges to prevent invalid PerformanceProfile
* Determines HugePages allocation based on cluster type
* Creates PerformanceProfile with proper node selector
* Shows configuration before applying (requires confirmation)

**Benefits of Using the Script:**

* **Prevents Errors**: Validates CPU ranges before creating PerformanceProfile
* **Interactive**: Shows configuration and asks for confirmation
* **Clear Output**: Displays profile summary and next steps
* **Error Handling**: Provides helpful error messages if creation fails

**The script will ask for confirmation before applying the PerformanceProfile.**
====
+
[NOTE]
====
If you see an error like `invalid range "0--2"`, this means the CPU allocation calculation failed. Run the CPU allocation calculator script again:

[source,bash]
----
bash ~/low-latency-performance-workshop/scripts/module04-calculate-cpu-allocation.sh
----

Then retry the Performance Profile creation.
====

=== Step 4: Monitor the Performance Profile Application

The Performance Profile will trigger a rolling update of your nodes. This process includes installing the real-time kernel and applying all the specified optimizations. The monitoring approach varies by cluster architecture.

. Monitor Machine Config Pool status based on cluster type:
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
# Load cluster configuration
source /tmp/cluster-config

echo "=== Monitoring Performance Profile Application ==="

    echo "   - Monitor 'master' Machine Config Pool"
    echo "   - Single node will reboot (cluster temporarily unavailable)"
    echo "   - Expect 5-15 minutes for RT kernel installation"
    echo ""
    echo "üìä Current master MCP status:"
    oc get mcp master
    echo ""
    echo "‚è±Ô∏è  Starting continuous monitoring (Ctrl+C to stop):"
    echo "watch 'oc get mcp master; echo; oc get nodes'"

    echo ""
    echo "üîç Multi-Node Monitoring Strategy:"
    echo "   - Monitor 'worker-rt' Machine Config Pool"
    echo "   - Worker nodes will reboot sequentially"
    echo "   - Control plane remains available"
    echo ""
    echo "üìä Current worker-rt MCP status:"
    oc get mcp worker-rt
    echo ""
    echo "‚è±Ô∏è  Starting continuous monitoring (Ctrl+C to stop):"

    echo ""
    echo "üìä Current master-rt MCP status:"
    oc get mcp master-rt
    echo ""
    echo "‚è±Ô∏è  Starting continuous monitoring (Ctrl+C to stop):"
    echo "watch 'oc get mcp master-rt; echo; oc get nodes'"

echo ""
echo "üìã Machine Config Status:"

    oc describe mcp master | grep -A 10 -B 5 "Conditions:"
elif [ "$CLUSTER_TYPE" = "MULTI_NODE" ]; then
    oc describe mcp worker-rt | grep -A 10 -B 5 "Conditions:"
else

=== Step 7: Validate kube-burner Test Pods and Cluster Stability

Before proceeding, let's validate that our performance tuning doesn't interfere with normal cluster operations and that kube-burner can successfully create and schedule pods.

== Module Summary

In this module, you have successfully implemented architecture-aware performance tuning:

‚úÖ *Detected* your cluster architecture (SNO, Multi-Node, or Multi-Master) +
‚úÖ *Created* an optimized Performance Profile tailored to your environment +
‚úÖ *Configured* CPU isolation appropriate for your cluster's control plane needs +
‚úÖ *Allocated* HugePages sized correctly for your available resources +
‚úÖ *Applied* real-time kernel settings for deterministic scheduling +
‚úÖ *Verified* all performance optimizations are working correctly +
‚úÖ *Measured* significant performance improvements through comparative testing

.*Architecture-Specific Achievements*

**Single Node OpenShift (SNO):**
* Conservative CPU allocation preserving control plane stability
* Optimized HugePages configuration for resource-constrained environments
* Master node targeting with appropriate performance isolation

**Multi-Node Clusters:**
* Aggressive CPU isolation on dedicated worker nodes
* Maximum performance optimization without control plane impact
* Dedicated Machine Config Pool for isolated performance tuning

**Multi-Master Clusters:**
* Balanced CPU allocation for control plane and workload performance
* Strategic node selection for performance optimization
* Maintained cluster stability during rolling updates

.*Key Takeaways*
* Performance Profiles adapt automatically to different cluster architectures
* CPU isolation strategies must account for control plane requirements
* Real-time kernels provide predictable, low-latency scheduling across all architectures
* HugePages allocation should be sized appropriately for available resources
* Proper architecture-aware tuning can achieve 50-70% latency improvements
* SNO environments can achieve exceptional performance due to simplified architecture

.*Performance Impact Summary*
Based on your cluster type, you should observe:
* **Pod Creation Latency**: 50-70% reduction in P99 times
* **Consistency**: Dramatically reduced variance between P50 and P99
* **Jitter**: More predictable and deterministic response times
* **Resource Utilization**: Optimized CPU and memory usage patterns

== Optional: Reverting Performance Tuning for Workshop Continuation

If you need to revert the performance tuning to continue with other workshop modules or if you experience any cluster stability issues, you can easily remove the performance optimizations.

=== When to Use the Revert Script

.*Revert Performance Tuning if you experience:*
* Pods failing to schedule or start
* Cluster becoming unresponsive
* High resource contention
* Need to continue with other workshop modules that require standard settings

.*Keep Performance Tuning if:*
* Cluster is stable and responsive
* Test pods are scheduling successfully
* You want to continue with performance-optimized settings
* Planning to proceed directly to Module 5 (Virtualization)

=== Manual Cleanup (Alternative)

If the automated script doesn't work, you can manually clean up:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
# Manual cleanup commands
echo "=== Manual Performance Tuning Cleanup ==="

# List and delete performance profiles
echo "üìã Current Performance Profiles:"
oc get performanceprofile

echo ""
echo "üóëÔ∏è  Delete Performance Profile:"
echo "oc delete performanceprofile <profile-name>"

# List and delete custom MCPs
echo ""
echo "üìã Current Machine Config Pools:"
oc get mcp

echo ""
echo "üóëÔ∏è  Delete custom MCP (if created):"
echo "oc delete mcp worker-rt  # or master-rt"

echo ""
echo "üí° After deletion, nodes will automatically reboot to standard kernel"
----

.*Next Steps*
In Module 5, you will learn how to apply these performance optimizations to OpenShift Virtualization, creating high-performance virtual machines that leverage your tuned infrastructure to achieve near bare-metal latency characteristics. The architecture-aware approach you've learned will be essential for optimizing VM placement and resource allocation.

[NOTE]
====
**Workshop Flexibility**: You can proceed to Module 5 either with or without the performance tuning active. The virtualization module will adapt to your current cluster configuration.
